# last-pencil
Last pencil game application.

Hyperskill project "Last pencil" (Introduction to Java). Stage 5/5.

Command line application for a game "Last pencil", where the player
that picks the last remaining pencil looses (can only pick max 3 pencils
at the time).

The user chooses who makes the first pick by typing in the name 'John' or 'Jack'.
The name 'John' will always be the user, and the name 'Jack' will always be an
AI-player. 

The AI-player is programmed to always analyze the game, and try to beat the user. 
It follows the logic:

1. If there are 2, 3 or 4 pencils left, the next player will always win. 

2. If there are 5 pencils left, the next player will loose. 

etc..
